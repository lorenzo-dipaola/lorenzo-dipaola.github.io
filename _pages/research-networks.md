My research is developed within national and international research networks working on comics studies, media ecology, visual culture, and digital cultures.

## Research networks

- **[SnIF – Studying ’n’ Investigating Fumetti](https://grupposnif.it/)**  
  SnIF is an Italian research network dedicated to comics studies. It promotes an international and interdisciplinary approach, bringing together scholars working on the history, theory, and sociology of comics. The network aims to foster dialogue between different critical traditions and to consolidate comics as a legitimate object of academic research, particularly within the Italian context.

- **[DiCuS Lab – Digital Cultures and Sports Research Laboratory (University of Salerno)](https://www.disps.unisa.it/dipartimento/strutture?id=740)**  
  DiCuS Lab develops research at the intersection of digital cultures, media, and sports. Its activities focus on the role of media and mediatization in contemporary cultural, social, and educational processes, including fandoms and audiences, seriality, transmedia imaginaries, media affects, digital platforms, and artificial intelligence. A second core area addresses sports narratives and industries, with particular attention to media representations, celebrity, identity construction, and the social and cultural functions of sport.

- **[COMICS – Children in Comics: An Intercultural History (Ghent University)](https://www.comics.ugent.be/)**  
  COMICS is an international research project devoted to the cultural history of European comics, with a specific focus on representations of childhood. Combining comics studies, childhood studies, and cultural history, the project examines comic strips and magazines from the late nineteenth century onwards, analysing how children and childhood have been shaped through popular visual narratives. While the ERC-funded project (2018–2024) has formally concluded, the research network continues through ongoing collaborations and related projects.

- **[ACME – (University of Liège)](https://acme.phl-lab.uliege.be/)**  
  ACME is an interdisciplinary research group focusing on comics studies and media ecology. Bringing together scholars from diverse methodological backgrounds—historical, sociological, aesthetic, institutional, and cognitive—the group investigates comics as cultural, industrial, and medial forms. ACME is also actively involved in academic publishing and editorial projects and is recognised as an FNRS Contact Group, reflecting its inter-university and international scope.
