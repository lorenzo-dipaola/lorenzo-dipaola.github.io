## Overview

**ViVo – Visualising Voices** is an FNRS-funded project hosted at the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB).
It investigates how early illustrated children’s periodicals remediated oral storytelling, with a focus on *Corriere dei Piccoli* (1908–1931).

## What I do

- Mapping recurring narrative formats and editorial strategies
- Analysing remediation of oral genres (storytelling, theatre, song, performance)
- Building an archive of key cases (covers, strips, layouts, paratexts)
- Connecting early print ecologies to later media environments (radio/TV/platform logics)
