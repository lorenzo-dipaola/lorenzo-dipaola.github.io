# ViVo – Visualising Voices

## Project overview

ViVo (*Visualising Voices*) is an FNRS-funded research project hosted at the Université libre de Bruxelles.  
The project investigates *Corriere dei Piccoli* (1908–1931) as a key laboratory of Italian media culture in the early twentieth century.

Rather than treating *Corriere dei Piccoli* as an “immature” or technically limited form of comics, ViVo approaches the magazine as a **specific editorial device**, designed to translate oral and performative traditions into printed culture for children. In this perspective, the magazine functions as a space of mediation between popular orality, bourgeois pedagogy, and the emerging logics of mass culture.

Combining archival research and media analysis, ViVo examines how images, texts, seriality, and advertising contributed to shaping new ways of reading, seeing, and learning.

## Phase 1 – Remediating orality: *La bande chantée*

The first phase of the project is grounded in the article *La bande chantée: tradition orale et croyances pédagogiques dans le Corriere dei Piccoli* (with Eva Van de Wiele).

The article reinterprets the use of rhymed captions instead of speech balloons not as a technical limitation, but as a **deliberate editorial choice**, closely linked to the cultural and pedagogical context of early twentieth-century Italy.

The analysis shows how the format of *Corriere dei Piccoli* remediates traditional performative practices, especially those of the **cantastorie**:

- illustrated posters are translated into the page grid;
- the sung voice becomes rhythmic, rhymed captions;
- public performance is relocated into domestic reading practices;
- ephemeral spectacle is transformed into printed seriality.

This model encourages adult-assisted reading and allows literacy training, pedagogical control, and early forms of cultural consumption to coexist within a single editorial environment.
