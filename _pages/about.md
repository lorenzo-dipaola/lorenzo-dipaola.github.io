I am an FNRS Postdoctoral Researcher at the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB).

My research lies at the intersection of media sociology, comics studies, and visual culture, with a specific focus on the evolution of comics within the digital ecosystem, media archaeology, and the sociology of the imagination.

I am the author of the monograph L’inafferrabile medium (2019) and a co-founder of the research network SNIF (Studying ’n’ Investigating Fumetti).

I am currently leading the FNRS-funded project ViVo – Visualising Voices.
