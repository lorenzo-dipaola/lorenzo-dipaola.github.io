## Research profile

My research lies at the intersection of **media ecology**, **cultural sociology**, and **comics studies**.  

My work addresses:
- comics as social and cultural media;
- moral panics, censorship, and symbolic governance;
- transmediality, seriality, and digital cultures;
- fandoms and participatory media practices.

I adopt a comparative and transnational approach, connecting historical media analysis with contemporary platformed cultures.
