### ◉ Where I start from

My research trajectory began with an interest in comics, understood not as a specialised genre or a self-contained language, but as an anomalous cultural object: a popular and often marginal medium, historically positioned at the crossroads of education, entertainment, and symbolic power.

Working on Italian comics and their relationships with journalism, children’s publishing, cinema, and television, my focus gradually shifted from individual works to the **media contexts** in which they are produced, circulated, and interpreted.

### ◎ Media as environments

This shift led me to mediology and media ecology, which I use to analyse media not simply as technologies or channels, but as **cultural environments**: complex systems that organise perception, structure social practices, and contribute to the symbolic regulation of modern societies.

From this perspective, comics provide a concrete entry point for examining how popular forms, cultural industries, and educational institutions interact, generating conflicts, compromises, and long-term transformations.

### ⟳ Continuity, remediation, history

A consistent line in my work concerns the continuity and transformation of cultural forms. Through a historical and media-archaeological approach, I examine how many dynamics commonly attributed to digital media — from seriality to participatory practices, and from moral anxieties to generational conflicts — have deep roots in twentieth-century media culture.

Rather than a sequence of radical breaks, media change appears as a process of **reconfiguration**, in which existing forms are adapted, displaced, and remediated over time.

### ⚑ Crisis, moral panics, regulation

In recent years, my research has increasingly focused on **moral panics**, censorship practices, and generational conflicts accompanying the emergence of new media. I approach these phenomena not as irrational reactions or merely repressive mechanisms, but as moments of crisis in which educational expectations, social fears, and attempts at symbolic governance become visible.

In this sense, media panics function as sensitive indicators of the tensions shaping the relationship between culture, technology, and authority.

### ▣ Current research

I am currently an FNRS Postdoctoral Researcher at the Université libre de Bruxelles, where I lead the project **ViVo – Visualising Voices**, devoted to the study of the remediation of orality in early illustrated children’s periodicals, with a particular focus on *Corriere dei Piccoli* (1908–1931).

Alongside this project, I am completing the monograph *Panic in Comics* (forthcoming, Leuven University Press), which examines the moral regulation of comics in post-war Italy.

### → In brief

Overall, my work aims to understand media change not through narratives of rupture or progress, but by tracing the slow, uneven, and often conflictual trajectories through which cultural forms persist, transform, and continue to produce meaning.
