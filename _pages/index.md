I am an FNRS Postdoctoral Researcher at the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB).

My research lies at the intersection of media sociology, comics studies, and visual culture, with a specific focus on the evolution of comics within the digital ecosystem , 
media archaeology, and the sociology of the imagination

Current work:

- **ViVo – Visualising Voices** (FNRS-funded project)
